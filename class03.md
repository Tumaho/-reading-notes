# Javascript Templating

### Javascript templating is a fast and efficient technique to render client-side view templates with Javascript by using a JSON data source. The template is HTML markup, with added templating tags that will either insert variables or run programming logic.

## Mustache

#### Mustache is a logic-less template syntax. It can be used for HTML, config files, source code â€” anything. It works by expanding tags in a template using values provided in a hash or object.

- flex-flow: is a shorthand property for setting both the flex-direction and flex-wrap properties.

- justify-content: is used to align the flex items.

- align-items: is used to align the flex items vertically.

#### flex item properties:

- flex-grow: specifies how much a flex item will grow relative to the rest of the flex items.

- flex-shrink: specifies how much a flex item will shrink relative to the rest of the flex items.
