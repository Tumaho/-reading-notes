# jQuery

### jQuery is a fast, small, cross-platform and feature-rich JavaScript library. It is designed to simplify the client-side scripting of HTML. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, animation, event handling, and AJAX very simple with an easy-to-use API that works on a lot of different type of browsers.

## Why use jquery

#### jQuery doesn't do anything you cannot achieve with pure JavaScript.It is just a JavaScript file but estimates show it has been used on over a quarter of the sites on the web, because it makes coding simpler. 

## jquery selection

#### jQuery is used to select (query) HTML elements and perform "actions" on them.

#### Basic syntax is: $("selector").action()

- The $ accesses jQuery.

- The (selector) finds HTML elements.

- The action() is then performed on the element(s).
