## What is functional programming?

#### Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data 

## Pure functions

#### It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic). It does not cause any observable side effects. It returns the same result if given the same arguments.

## Immutability

#### Unchanging over time or unable to be changed. When data is immutable, its state cannot change after it’s created. If you want to change an immutable object, you can’t. Instead, you create a new object with the new value.

## Map

#### map is to transform a collection.

### There’s a middle ground between speed and comprehension and that’s where good code lives. so we need time but also we need **Performance** and **Readability**
